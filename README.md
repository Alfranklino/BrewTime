# BREWTIME

BrewTime is a [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) based project. This mobile app (obviously) aim to allow users to find a brewery, book a tour, browse from the store and finally purchase some articles. This project is full stack project. That means both the backend and the frontend have been developped. For that you will find inside the project Repo 2 folders: server and client. For the backend i used a [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) + [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as the main tools. The frontend is a pure React-native based code.
